# StreamUtilities
I wrote this project to manage my Twitch stream on a single monitor, code quality is very fast. :(
I's similar to [See Through Windows](https://www.mobzystems.com/tools/seethroughwindows.aspx) and [WindowTop](https://windowtop.info/) but is thinked for streaming pourpose! :D ...my source of inspiration!
    
### Key features:    
- Allows you to track windows (for example OBS chats, events) and set them top-most with different opacities
        
- Allows you to use a special hotkey combination in game and toggle tracked windows (StreamUtilities can work in background mode without problems!)
        
- Allows you to connect Twitch account (special thanks to TwitchLib!); this key feature starts a bot that can listen events (chat, sub...) and activate previous tracked windows with a notification sound if necessary
        
- StreamUtilities store all user settings in config file. The user's sensitive data will not be collected or sent! (stay safe!)
